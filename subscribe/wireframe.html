        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>
          The audience I will be looking for is people looking what they should
          do for their big trip. Usually families, couples, or people wanting to
          explore the world. They would be wanting to see something truely
          different and feel like a whole different place when coming to
          Cambodia. We would want the people to sign up for our tour guides so
          they wouldn't be so confused, in danger, and shocked when coming to
          the country.

        <h3>Why should you come here</h3>
        <p>
          [Why people would come to this site? Tourists looking for a fresh new
          look, outside of America trying something new. They will want to see
          whats diverse the world really is. With Cambodia being a third world
          country but so much culture and a different look than so many other
          countries it will be their place to try something new. A question
          people will ask if Cambodia is a dangerous place for tourist since it
          is a third world country. And the answer is no it is actually pretty
          safe for tourist and has been growing in popularity over the years.
          The people there love tourists coming in and meeting new people so you
          will give a warming welcome. We do recommend having a a tour guide
          though because of the language and culture shock you would face coming
          here. Our tour guides will give you a full week to basically try out
          everything. We booked an amazing resort next to the capital, Phnom
          Penh, so you are right next to the streets checking out if you want to
          look around. The next few days we travel and then go let you check out
          at the beach, allowing you to sleep with the waves and famous glowing
          plankton on your view. We also have our tour guides fluent in Khmer
          having them help you with communications.
